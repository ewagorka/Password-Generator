# Password-Generator
Week 5 challenge of the Front-End Development Bootcamp

## Project Description
I started this challenge as usual by reading the instructions and studying the provided code.

After studying the code, I went ahead and put a bunch of console.log commands in the Javascript file to help me understand how the functions work. Then after I got some basic understanding and ideas on how to solve this challenge, I read the criteria again and split the work into smaller pieces that I could handle.

It was pretty simple to divide the work - I just made each function a separate task. For every task, I did the same thing:
* created a new branch
* figured out what the function needed to do and what they should return (I used comments to explain each step within each function)
* initialised any necessary variables
* made sure the function checked the user's input correctly
* tested the function to make sure it worked.

As mentioned above, the explanation of how each function works can be found in the comments in the Javascript file.

Below I'll list the key outcomes I got from working on each function:
1. getPasswordOptions()
* I learned how useful objects can be to hold multiple values of multiple types, that belong to one category (I used an object to store all user password preferences)
* I learned how to use .some method on objects to check if some of its attributes check given criteria
2. getRandom(arr)
* I practised the Math.floor() and Math.random() methods to generate a random number from a given range of numbers
3. generatePassword()
* I learned how to use functions within functions, to get all the necessary data
* I practised using while loops (and breaking from them at certain points) and if statements
* I learned how to turn an array into a single string by using the .join method

In comparison to the previous challenges, this one proved to be considerably more challenging. However, it was also a lot of fun to work on, and it was very rewarding to see it work in the end.  


## My Approach
I started off by reading the instructions and studying the provided code.

After that I've put a lot of console.log commands within the code to better understand how it works and how I can use the functions within each other. After that read the criteria again, divided it into more managable tasks and started to code.
